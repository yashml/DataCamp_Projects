Designed by expert instructors, DataCamp Projects are an essential step in the learning process as they encourage learning by doing. This repository has my solutions to [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/yashml) projects. 

In these projects I have  applied my skills by doing an end-to-end analysis on tasks, using tools and workflows. I have also mentioned the dataset, language, skills used and new learnings of each project in the respective project description.
