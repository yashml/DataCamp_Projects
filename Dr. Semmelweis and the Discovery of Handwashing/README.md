# Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing

In this project I will reanalyse the data behind one of the most important discoveries of modern medicine: handwashing.

### Dataset: 

- Dataset consists of 2 csv files which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/yashml/DataCamp_Projects/tree/master/Dr.%20Semmelweis%20and%20the%20Discovery%20of%20Handwashing/datasets). 

### Language and Packages:

- Python: pandas

### Skills:

- Data Manipulation
- Data Visualization
- Importing and Cleaning
- Probability and Statistics

### New Learnings:

- Using *ax* object and giving it as an argument in the plot statement we plot two or more lines in the same plot. The ax object can be used to further modify the plot.
- Running bootstrap analysis using *.sample(frac=1, replace=True)* to check the uncertainity of the estimate.
